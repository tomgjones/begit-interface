# Description

[[mkgitmin.1]] creates a new minimal but non-empty repository.

[[begit.1]] can be used for idempotent creation of a respository.
It only creates a new repository if there isn't one there already,
and a post-creation program can be specified on the command line too.

This means that `begit` can be inserted into service startup scripts,
so that the respository is created the first time the service is run,
but no error is generated on subsequent runs, once the respository
already exists.

# Examples

Create a new repository on a git server:

    $ mkgitmin /srv/git/repos/foo

Create a new repository, but quit without error if it already exists:

    $ begit /srv/git/repos/foo

Similar, but with a working copy, rather than being a bare repo:

    $ mkgitmin -B ~/mystuff

Create a new repository if it doesn't already exist. On creation,
run a hypothetical
program to alter git's `config` file:

    begit -B ~/mynewrepo gitconfigapply ~/mynewrepo user.name Bill
