.Nd create minimal but non-empty git repository, repeatably
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl B
.Ar DIR
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates a non-empty git repository with minimal content in the directory
.Ar DIR .

By default a bare repository is created; a non-bare 
repository can be produced instead by giving the 
.Fl B
option.

The history of the created repository 
involves the addition and removal of an empty
.Pa .gitignore
file.  Authors' email addresses are in an invalid domain, and
all timestamps are set to tea time, shortly after the beginning
of the epoch.
.Nm
output tends to produce repeatable output, in that repeated runs will result in
HEAD being at a commit with the same sha-1 id,
but the interface does not guarantee what the particular commit id will
be.

.Nm
must be run on an empty or non-existent directory; running it on a
non-empty directory is an error.

.Sh EXAMPLES
    $ mkgitmin /srv/git/repos/foo
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh VERSION
Part of version 0.1 of the begit interface.
